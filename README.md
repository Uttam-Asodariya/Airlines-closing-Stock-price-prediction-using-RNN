# Airlines-closing-Stock-price-prediction-using-RNN
These days, everyone seems to be talking about Artificial Neural Networks. Mostly, this refers to classical Dense or Convolutional Neural Networks, which for instance are used for image classification. This report is intended to deal with another type of neural network specialized for time series: the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The list of amazing applications of RNNs is long - it ranges from speech translation over object detection in videos to music composition. But what could we do with Recurrent Neural Networks that would really move the world forward? Well, obviously: money. Therefore, this report will document the attempt to predict stock prices from the preceding price sequence. To give our RNN a nice run for its money, we downloaded American Airlines’ closing stock price from the past 15 years. Let’s see how far we can get.
